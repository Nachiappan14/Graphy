# Graphy
download the graphy files in your system
go to that particular downloaded directory in terminal and run the install.py to install the required libraries by running the command below.
python3 install.py
and now you are prepared to start graphing. Run graphy.py to start graphing by the command
python3 graphy.py
i will ask you to input the equation for y.please do so in the format you generally use in the interactive interpreter of the python.
e.g:- use tan(x) for tan x
      use x**2 for x^2,
      use exp(x) for e^x,
      use atan(x) for tan-1(x),
      and so on
 A new window will appear on the screen containing the graph and the zoom in and zoom out buttons 
 click on zoom in button and zoom out button for corresponding effects
 and click any other place in the window to close the window.
 
 accuracy is the factor that is build for the people who needs high accuracy.you will be asked to enter a accuracy factor so enter it in the range of 1 to 10 unless you need high accuracy.
 never give a negative or a value less than one
 higher the value of accuracy given higher the time taken by the system to sketch the graph.so please mind it.....
 and thats it.....
 ENJOY GRAPHING
